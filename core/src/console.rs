//! Keeps the terminal for the few lines that are meant for a person.
//!
//! The protocol crate prints an entire swap report to stdout with `println!` when a swap ends
//! (`taker/api.rs`), and it is not ours to patch. That report is persisted beside the wallet
//! on the very next line of the same function and rendered in the app, so the copy that lands
//! in the terminal carries nothing the user cannot already see — it only buries the one line
//! they came back for, which is the URL.
//!
//! [`detach`] therefore points file descriptor 1 at `/dev/null` and hands back a duplicate of
//! the real one. Anything printing to stdout from then on is discarded; the host writes its
//! own lines to the [`Console`] instead. Under a supervisor that duplicate is still the
//! captured pipe, so `docker logs` and journald keep seeing what we deliberately write.
